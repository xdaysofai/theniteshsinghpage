      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi, my name is Nitesh Singh, curator of xdaysofWeb3. My first introduction to cryptocurrency occurred on August 16, 2010, with Bitcoin's first hack event.</p>
      <p>Since then, I have been maintaining xdaysofWeb3 as a personal diary to keep track of it for my friends and family (AdSense used to hate cryptocurrency). Though I registered the domain in 2025, I was surprised that someone left this awesome domain.</p>
      <p>I also set up a Bitcoin full node (still running) on August 15, 2010, to investigate the Value Overflow incident, which (according to folks I’ve met since) may have been India’s first.</p>
      <p>For me, Bitcoin was never a “eureka” moment. It was an invitation—to learn tech, explore maths, understand finance and global economics, and dive into probability, topology, macro theory, flying cars, robotics… and to document it along the way.</p>
      <p>Apart from that, I also founded <a href="https://www.teamsosindia.in">Team SOS India Foundation</a>, a volunteer-driven legal aid and disaster-relief network. I served as its first President until 2025.</p>
